# Demo instructions

1. Run `yarn install` to install all dependencies.
2. Run `yarn build-and-serve` to build the project, and start a server to serve it.
   The server, by default, listens to [port 8080](http://localhost:8080). You can configure the server to serve at another port by setting environment variable `PORT`.
   For example, to serve at port 3000:
   ```
   PORT=3000 yarn build-and-serve
   ```
